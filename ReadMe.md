# What is this? 
This is an adaptation of a Discord PLE prediction tournament that my friends and I participate in for fun. 

# Why make this? 
This was created to streamline the process of voting on matches and who we believed the winners would be. It will help to tally the scores at the end of the show and year rather than keeping the scores on the Discord thread. It will also make inputting the matches a little quicker and easier.
